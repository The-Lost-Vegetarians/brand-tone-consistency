# Brand Tone Detection, Consistency and Transliteration

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a model that can detect the tone of any text that is to be used in the context of marketing for a brand.
It also involves transliterating English text to Indian languages - Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam

## Proposed Ideas
### 1. Brand Tone Analysis
Use the tool to evaluate the overall tone of a brand across various marketing channels (ads, social media, emails).
Goal: Understand how a brand communicates through language, and identify the dominant tones.

### 2. Multi-label Tone Detection
Allow the tool to detect multiple tones in a single piece of text (e.g., "Friendly" and "Motivational" can be detected for an email campaign).

### 3. Source-Type Specific Tone Detection
Understand how a brand adapts its tone across different platforms (social media, email, website).
Goal: Compare how different channels influence tone and engagement.

### 4. Transliteration
Enable users to enter Romanized text and convert it to Hindi, Tamil, and Malayalam scripts.
Goal: Support multilingual marketing materials and users who are more comfortable with native scripts.

## Project tasks in a nutshell
### 1. Data Scraping & Preprocessing
Scrape marketing content (social media, ads, emails).
Clean text data (remove unnecessary punctuation, whitespace).
Tokenization and text formatting for model input.
Language detection (using langid or similar libraries).

### 2. Model Development
Tone Detection Model:
Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT or similar transformer model for tone detection.
Multi-label classification for predicting multiple tones.
Transliteration Model:
Use indic-transliteration for converting Romanized text to native scripts.

### 3. Model Training
Label your training data with tone annotations (e.g., “Friendly”, “Bold”, “Motivational”).
Train the tone detection model using labeled datasets.
Fine-tune pre-existing models with brand-specific data.

### 4. Analysis Features
Brand Tone: Aggregating tones from various pieces of content for each brand.
Source-Type Tone: Analyzing how a brand’s tone changes across different channels.
Deviation from Target Tone: Compare the tone of input text with the desired target tone.

### 5. Integrating Transliteration
Build a user input system for Romanized text to be transliterated into Hindi, Tamil, and Malayalam.
Add language detection to identify the correct script (Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam).

### 6. UI/UX Development
Develop a user interface that allows users to input text, view tone results, and transliterate content.
Show tone analysis results for various brand texts.
Provide feedback on tone deviation from target tones.

## Future Enhancements
### 1. Analyse Tone in native language.
### 2. Provide a comprehensive dashboard providing complete analysis about how a brand uses tones for unique marketing.
